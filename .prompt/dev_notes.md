# Development Notes - AI-Driven Development Log
## Campus Resource Hub - AiDD 2025 Capstone

**Developer:** Reid Zona  
**AI Assistant:** GitHub Copilot  
**Project Start:** November 9, 2025

---

## Session 1: Project Initialization (November 9, 2025)

### Initial Challenge
Started with wrong project direction - created ML/Data Science project based on misunderstanding of "AIDD" acronym. Assumed "AI in Data-Driven Decision Making" instead of "AI-Driven Development."

**Lesson Learned:** Always verify project requirements document before implementation.

### Course Correction
After receiving project specification document (`2025_AiDD_Core_Final_Project (1).txt`), realized need for full-stack web application. Deleted all ML-related files and started fresh with Flask application.

### AI Interactions - Session 1

**Prompt 1: Repository Connection**
```
Connect this workspace to existing GitHub repository
```
**Outcome:** Successfully connected to https://github.com/rzona-msis/AIDD-Final.git

**Prompt 2: Project Structure**
```
Create comprehensive AIDD project structure with data processing, ML models, notebooks
```
**Outcome:** Created wrong project (ML/Data Science). Had to delete.

**Prompt 3: Course Correction**
```
[User provided project specification document]
Build Campus Resource Hub - full-stack web application per specification
```
**Outcome:** Deleted ML project files, created proper Flask MVC structure

**Prompt 4: Advanced Feature Selection**
```
Implement WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility as advanced feature
```
**Outcome:** Systematic implementation of accessibility features throughout

---

## Session 2: Core Application Development (November 9, 2025)

### Architecture Decisions

**Decision 1: Flask over Django**
- **Reasoning:** Lighter weight, better for learning, explicit over implicit
- **Trade-off:** More manual configuration vs Django's batteries-included approach
- **Result:** Greater control and understanding of each component

**Decision 2: MVC with Separate DAL**
- **Reasoning:** Clear separation of concerns, testability, maintainability
- **Pattern:** Controllers → DAL → Models
- **Result:** Clean architecture, easy to modify database operations

**Decision 3: SQLite for Development**
- **Reasoning:** Zero configuration, file-based, sufficient for MVP
- **Migration Path:** SQLAlchemy makes PostgreSQL migration trivial
- **Result:** Fast development iteration

### AI-Assisted Code Generation

**Component: Database Models**
```
Prompt: Create User model with authentication, role-based access, relationships
AI Generated: User model with Flask-Login integration, bcrypt password hashing
Modifications: Added profile_image field, enhanced role checking methods
```

**Component: Data Access Layer**
```
Prompt: Create UserDAL with CRUD operations, authentication, role queries
AI Generated: Complete DAL class with all necessary methods
Modifications: Added bulk operations, enhanced search functionality
```

**Component: Controllers (Blueprints)**
```
Prompt: Create resources controller with CRUD, authorization checks, owner verification
AI Generated: Complete blueprint with all routes
Modifications: Enhanced error handling, added flash messages
```

### Effective Prompting Strategies

**Strategy 1: Contextual Prompts**
- Always mention "Campus Resource Hub - AiDD 2025 Capstone" in file headers
- Reference existing files and patterns
- Specify compliance requirements (WCAG, security)

**Strategy 2: Incremental Development**
- Build layer by layer: models → DAL → controllers → views
- Test each layer before moving to next
- AI maintains consistency when given clear progression

**Strategy 3: Specification-Driven**
- Reference PRD and project requirements in prompts
- Mention specific WCAG criteria when building templates
- Request security features explicitly

---

## Session 3: Accessibility Implementation (November 9, 2025)

### WCAG Compliance Approach

**Phase 1: Semantic HTML**
```
Prompt: Create base.html with semantic HTML5, ARIA landmarks, skip navigation
AI Generated: Complete base template with proper structure
Enhancements: Added breadcrumb navigation, enhanced footer
```

**Phase 2: Keyboard Navigation**
- Focus indicators via CSS (3px solid outline)
- Logical tab order in all forms
- Skip links for main content

**Phase 3: Screen Reader Support**
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- ARIA live regions for flash messages
- Descriptive alt text on images

**Phase 4: Visual Accessibility**
- Color contrast 4.5:1 for text
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Reduced motion media query support

### AI Strengths in Accessibility

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Import Errors During Development
**Problem:** Expected import errors while building components
**Solution:** Document as "expected until dependencies installed"
**AI Role:** AI correctly identified these as expected

### Challenge 2: Circular Dependencies
**Problem:** Models referencing each other caused import issues
**Solution:** Forward references in SQLAlchemy relationships
**AI Role:** AI suggested backref patterns to avoid issues

### Challenge 3: CSRF Token Management
**Problem:** Ensuring all forms include CSRF tokens
**Solution:** Flask-WTF auto-generation, manual addition in templates
**AI Role:** AI consistently included CSRF tokens in forms

### Challenge 4: Authorization Logic
